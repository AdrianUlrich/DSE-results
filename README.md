# DSE Grading Result Counter

This is a small python script that counts and prints
the results of the linter and the homeworks for DSE.

It expects to be run in a folder with the csv grading
output files which were generated by the grading script
(in the releases of each homework).

## Usage

1. Download the csv files from the moodle
2. (Optional) Rename the csv files so that they are
in the order of the homeworks (hw0, hw1, hw2, hw3)
to get output in order
3. Run the script (```python3 count_results.py```)
4. (Optional) Copy the output to the
[grading sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KUmrWpgfPFzuyFw2fq2d10IXRkLV-xNgXSOxukhTe_M/edit?usp=sharing)
   (Make a copy first)

## Output

The output is a table of results and percentages in stdout.

The output percentages can be used to **_fill in the results in the grading sheet_** provided on the moodle.

## Notes

We assume that tests all count the same per homework,
so we just count the number of passed tests
and divide by the total number of tests in that homework.
